              Protection Act (CalOPPA)
            </h4>
            <p>Our Service does not respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>
            <p>
              However, some third party websites do keep track of Your browsing
              activities. If You are visiting such websites, You can set Your
              preferences in Your web browser to inform websites that You do not
              want to be tracked. You can enable or disable DNT by visiting the
              preferences or settings page of Your web browser.

            <h4>7. Children's Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
              knowingly collect personally identifiable information or Personal
              Data from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or
              guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with
              Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have
              collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without
              verification of parental consent, We take immediate steps to
              remove that Personal Data from Our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also may limit how We collect, use, and store some of the
              Information of Users between 13 and 18 years old. In some cases,
              this means We will be unable to provide certain functionality of
              the Service to these users.
            </p>
            <p>
              If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your
              Information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We
              may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
              information.
            </p>

              operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be
              directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to
              review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have no control over and assume no responsibility or liability
              for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party
              sites or services. If You click on a link to a website not

              proceeding on that third party website.
            </p>
