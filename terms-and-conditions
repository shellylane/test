            </p>

            <h6>Subscriptions:</h6>
            <p>
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
              ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
              and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set
              either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
              subscription plan You select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, Your Subscription will
              automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You
              cancel it or Company cancels it. You may cancel Your Subscription
              renewal either through Your online account management page or by
              contacting the Company's customer support team at
              <a href="mailto:support@tortus.io">support@tortus.io</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
              process the payment for Your Subscription. You shall provide
              Company with accurate and complete billing information including
              full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
              payment method information. By submitting such payment
              information, You automatically authorize Company to charge all
              Subscription fees incurred through Your account to any such
              payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Company
              will issue an electronic invoice indicating that You must proceed
              manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
              corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            </p>

            <h6>Free Trial</h6>
            <p>
              Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a
              free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
            </p>
            <p>
              You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to
              sign up for the Free Trial.
            </p>
            <p>
              If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for the
              Free Trial, You will not be charged by Company until the Free
              Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period,
              unless You canceled Your Subscription, You will be automatically
              charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
              Subscription You have selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time and without notice, Company reserves the right to (i)
              modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
              cancel such Free Trial offer.
            </p>

            <h6>Fee Changes</h6>
            <p>
              Company in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the
              Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee
              change will become effective at the end of the then-current
              Billing Cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any
              change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to
              terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
              change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the
              modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>

            <h6>Refunds</h6>
            <p>
              Refund requests will be considered on a case by case basis by the
              Company and may be granted or denied in the sole discretion of
              Company.

              hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by
              operation of law, without Our prior written consent. Any purported
              assignment or delegation by You without Our appropriate prior

            </p>

            <p>
              We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace
              these Terms and Conditions at any time. If a revision is material
              We will endeavor to provide at least fifteen (15) days’ notice

            <h6>General Terms</h6>

            <span class="italic">Payments</span>
            <p>
              We never take custody of money. You transfer using the Service and
              We are not responsible for what recipients do with the payments
              You make. For example, We are not responsible if a Landlord
              returns a tenant’s deposit or if a payor or payor’s bank or card
              issuer initiates a reversal, chargeback, or dispute of a payment
              made to You. You authorize Us and our third-party payment
              providers to reverse or otherwise debit funds from Your account in
              accordance with the applicable financial institutions and network
              policies and procedures. In the event We are unable to reverse or
              otherwise debit funds from Your account, You agree promptly to
              deposit such funds upon Our request. We may also initiate a
              reversal or other debit, or take other actions We determine to be
              appropriate if We believe fraud or other abuse of the Service has
              occurred.
            </p>

            <span class="italic">Verification Procedures</span>
            <p>
              You hereby authorize us, directly or through third parties, to
              make any inquiries We consider necessary to validate Your identity
              and/or authenticate Your identity and account information. This
              may include asking You for further information and/or
              documentation about Your Account usage or identity, or requiring
              You to take steps to confirm ownership of Your email address,
              wireless/cellular telephone number or financial instruments, and
              verifying Your information against third party databases or
              through other sources. This process is for internal verification
              purposes. You further understand that We may charge a fee for this
              verification process.
            </p>

            <span class="italic">Account Access</span>
            <p>
              In some cases, it is necessary for Our employees, contractors, or
              agents to access Your Account and content in order to diagnose a
              problem. When You contact Our support team, it is implied that You
              are allowing Us to access Your account if necessary, in order to
              be helpful. If You wish to receive assistance without granting
              permission to Your account, please specify as much in Your
              communication with Our support team and those requests will be
              honored to the extent possible.
            </p>

            <span class="italic">Advertising and Account Access</span>
            <p>
              Some of the Service may be supported by advertising revenue and
              may display advertisements and promotions, and You hereby agree
              that We may place such advertising and promotions on the Service
              or on, about, or in conjunction with Your Content. The manner,
              mode, and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to
              change without specific notice to You.
            </p>

            <span class="italic">Service Interruption</span>
            <p>
              Although it is our intention for the Service to be available as
              much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be
              interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled
              maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, for unscheduled
              downtime, for system and server failures, or due to failure of
              telecommunications links and/or equipment. Consequently, We
              encourage You to maintain Your own backup of Your Content. In
              other words, We are not a backup service and You agree that You
              will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or
              storage. We will not be liable to You for any modification,
              suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any
              User Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be
              subject to breaches of security and that the submission of User
              Content or other information may not be secure.
